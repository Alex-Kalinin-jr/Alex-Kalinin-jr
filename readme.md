It starts with diving into C-language and continues to climbing up to cyber-security and so on.

- linux and related technologies, (and yes, i'm still on *Bullseye*, because *Bookwarm* is not run-in enough).
- databases, from ANSI-sql up to big retail-analytics projects in postgres.
- C language, from self-made cat and grep up to C-written 3D-Viewer.
- C++ language, from calculator up to algorithms and parallel programming.
- python, from flask up to self-written C-packages.<br>

- I am well acquainted with modern technologies, such as Docker, CI-CD, git, testing libs, debugging and
other necessary development infrastructure.<br>
- Also i am pretty good in writing/reading English.<br>
- My designer's (aircraft) experience give me obvious benefits in depth and structured learning of programming languages.
